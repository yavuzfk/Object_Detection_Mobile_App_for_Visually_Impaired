# OBJECT DETECTION APPLICATION FOR THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED

### ABSTRACT

A mobile application that detects objects for visually imapaired individuals will be developed in this project. 
Thanks to the targeted application, it is aimed for visually impaired individuals to find the objects they are looking for in daily life
more easily. The object detection method in computer vision will be used in the application.
After the objects are detected, the distance of the object and its location will be tried to be
determined for the convenience of the visually impaired individual. Then, the names and
location information of the identified objects will be sent to the visually impaired individual
as a voice message. In addition, the way the application works will be shared with the user
via voice message, and in this way, the visually impaired individuals will be able to use it
comfortably. Finally, it will be subjected to tests on how accurately the created software can
detect objects and its behavior in different conditions.
